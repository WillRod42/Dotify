# Dotify HW1
William Rodriguez

### Description of App
Dotify is a very basic Spotify clone. Only has one screen where the user can change the username, tap play to increase the number of plays, and tap the next and previous track buttons to receive a small popup message. Includes an album cover, song title, artist, number of plays, and a username.

### Extra Credit Attempts
- (1.) A user is not allowed to apply a new username if the edit text field is empty.
- (4.) All hardcoded dimensions & colors are extracted into res/values/dimens.xml & res/values/colors.xml respectively.
