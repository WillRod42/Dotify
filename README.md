# Dotify HW2
William Rodriguez

### Description of App
Dotify is a very basic Spotify clone. Has two screens, one where the user can tap play to increase the number of plays, and tap the next and previous track buttons to receive a small popup message. Includes an album cover, song title, artist, and number of plays. The main screen is a list of songs the user can tap to change the what the mini-player at the bottom of the screen is playing, press the shuffle button to shuffle the list, and tap the mini-player to enter the song player screen.
